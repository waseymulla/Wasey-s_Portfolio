          Career in Tech üñ•Ô∏è
          <br />
          <span class="mini_p">
            My journey into the world of coding and web development began with a
            curiosity to understand how technology shapes our lives and the
            endless possibilities it offers for innovation. As a passionate
            coder and tech enthusiast, I've embarked on a mission to explore the
            intersection of creativity and technology, leveraging my skills to
            build impactful solutions. One of my most rewarding endeavors was
            working on a prototype mobile application during my time at Atticus
            Capital,I led the design and development of a user-friendly investment portfolio mobile app. I created a cross-platform application with optimized performance and seamless API integration. Implementing robust security measures and connecting the app with MongoDB, I ensured data integrity and accessibility for users, fostering engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, my background in machine
            learning, gained through my role as a Machine Learning Engineer
            Intern at INMO.AI, has equipped me with the knowledge and expertise
            to tackle complex data-driven challenges and develop sophisticated
            predictive models.

          Rock Climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

          <br />
          <span class="mini_p">
            Rock climbing and bouldering are my passions, my way of immersing
            myself in nature and pushing my physical limits. I'm particularly
            drawn to bouldering, a form of freehand climbing that requires
            problem-solving skills, agility, and mental focus. I find a striking
            parallel between the problem-solving aspect of bouldering and my
            approach to coding. Just as I tackle complex coding problems with
            determination and ingenuity, I embrace the mental and physical
            challenges of bouldering, constantly seeking new heights and pushing
            boundaries. Bouldering, much like coding, demands patience,
            technique, and a willingness to learn from both successes and
            failures.

            Music has always been a source of inspiration and joy in my life,
            and my passion for exploring diverse musical genres led me to
            discover the vibrant world of K-Pop. From its catchy melodies to its
            dynamic choreography, K-Pop captivates me with its energy and
            creativity. I find myself drawn to the way K-Pop artists blend
            different musical styles and visuals to create captivating
            performances that resonate with audiences worldwide. Whether I'm
            listening to my favorite K-Pop tracks or exploring new releases,
            music serves as a constant source of inspiration and motivation in
