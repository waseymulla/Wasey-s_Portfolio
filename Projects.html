            <div class="bullet">
              During the summer and fall semesters of 2023, the Graduate
              Advising Office at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) faced
              challenges in responding to and maintaining the needs of current
              and incoming Computer Science (CS) students due to limited advisor
              staff. To address this issue, our team embarked on creating an
              automated solution to expedite the degree planning and auditing
              process for sophomore and senior students.
            </div>

            <div class="underline">Approach:</div>
            <div class="bullet">
              We designed a user-friendly web application featuring three forms
              for inputting student information. The first form collects general
              student details, including name, student ID, major degree track,
              and anticipated graduation. The second form focuses on course
              completion, categorizing completed courses into different levels
              and categories. We implemented drag-and-drop functionality for
              degree track courses and manual entry for elective courses. The
              third form captures detailed information about each individual
              course, essential for GPA calculations and report generation.
            </div>
            <div class="bullet">
              Additionally, we developed an administration page to facilitate
              easyupdates to course offerings, degree tracks, and GPA
              requirements. This page allows administrators to modify existing
              data and add or remove degree tracks and courses as needed.

          <div class="bullet">
            The research project aimed to address the challenges associated with
            query optimization in databases, particularly focusing on
            maintaining semantic equivalence while enhancing query performance.
            Our team explored the application of U-Semiring Algebra for SQL
            query equivalence verification, contributing to the advancement of
            database query optimization methodologies.

          <div class="underline">Research Issue:</div>
          <div class="bullet">
            Efficient query optimization plays a crucial role in improving
            database performance by minimizing the number of accessed rows.
            However, ensuring that optimized queries maintain semantic
            equivalence with their original counterparts poses a significant
            challenge. Our project aimed to address this issue by rigorously
            testing the equivalence of optimized and unoptimized queries.
          </div>

          <div class="underline">Contributions:</div>
          <div class="bullet">
            Our project successfully validated the semantic equivalence of SQL
            queries through meticulous analysis and testing. We implemented the
            U-Semiring algorithm to systematically manipulate unoptimized
            queries and observe their transformations into optimized versions.
            This validation process involved exhaustive testing to ensure that
            the optimized queries consistently produced equivalent results to
            their original counterparts. Additionally, our project developed a
            Query Analyzer tool to facilitate comprehensive verifications,
            highlighting our dedication to ensuring both semantic and logical
            equivalence between query versions.

            Our implementation replicated the research paper's methodology on a
            common test database, demonstrating the effectiveness of U-Semiring
            Algebra in creating equivalent queries. We imported a complex DBMS,
            utilized the sqlglot library for SQL manipulation, and compared the
            execution times of optimized and unoptimized queries. The project
            employed various strategies, including tree manipulation and query
            timing, to assess equivalence and optimize queries effectively.

            Our evaluation process included SQL query comparison and
            manipulation, showcasing an average 8% improvement in query
            execution times. Through rigorous testing and manipulation steps, we
            demonstrated the effectiveness of U-Semiring Algebra in maintaining
            semantic equivalence while enhancing query performance.
